## ⚠️ About Windows Defender

Recent versions of SQLiDumper may be **falsely flagged as malicious by Windows Defender**. This is due to the tool's advanced automation and networking behaviors, which can trigger real-time protection heuristics—even though the tool itself is clean and fully functional.

> 💡 **Recommendation:** If you receive a security warning, verify the file source and consider using SQLiDumper in an isolated and secure environment (e.g., virtual machine or sandbox) with real-time protection temporarily disabled.
